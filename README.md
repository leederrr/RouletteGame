# RouletteGame

## Background
Typical roulette casino game that prints to your console. Roulette wheel in this game uses numbers 1-36. This program is predominantly written in C++ and calls Python and R to generate graphs for low vs high numbers pulled and red vs black numbers pulled. 

## Installations

## Rules
The user will be greeted with a game menu for options. The user will have the option to change their default currency (which is set to $1000 USD). Otherwise, they will begin the game with $1000 USD and be prompted to enter a betting wage amount. Then they will be prompted to select the number they predict will be pulled at random. If the user guesses correctly, they will receive double their betting wage. If the user guesses incorrectly, they will lose exactly the amount that they had bet on. The game proceeds until either the user runs out of currency or they end the game. 

In order to see the visual graphics, you, of course, have to play the game. The visuals created with Python will automatically appear each time a number is pulled. The Python script generates a chart for low versus high numbers that are pulled in live time. The visuals created with R will automatically appear each time a number is pulled as well, however the images are then "sent" to a folder directory called "images."
